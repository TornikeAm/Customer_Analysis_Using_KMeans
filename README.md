# Customer Analysis Project Using K-Means

## Overview

This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze customer data. K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for clustering similar data points into groups or clusters. In this project, we aim to gain insights into our customer base by segmenting them into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics. Results are in the IPYNB File

## Project Description

In this project, we perform the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the customer data that will be used for analysis. This dataset may include various features such as purchase history, demographics, and behavioral data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and convert categorical variables into a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize or normalize the features to ensure that all variables have the same scale. This step is crucial when using K-Means as it is distance-based.

4. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities. Experiment with different values of K to find the optimal number of clusters.

5. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Interpret the results of the clustering analysis to gain insights into customer segments. Understand the characteristics and behavior of each cluster.

6. **Visualization**: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate the clusters and make the results more interpretable.
